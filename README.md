Methods introduction

  For discrete disordered variables, feature engineering USES pd. Dummies to transform one-hot features.
  For continuous data, the characteristic engineering is standardized. Compare features as discrete ordered data or continuous data?
  For discrete ordered data, the relationship between the dependent variable and the continuous data is first explored, and then the feasibility of other data types is discussed according to the actual situation.

Modeling process:

  Data exploration: read data, missing value, variable type, data type, etc.;
  Data cleaning: variable classification, type conversion, normalization or standardization;
  Feature engineering: feature correlation analysis, feature construction and feature selection;
  Model construction: initial model, integration model, reference model, cross-validation;
  Index evaluation: f1-score, AUC analysis, memory occupancy;
